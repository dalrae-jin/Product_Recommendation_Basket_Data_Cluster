# Product_Recommendation_Basket_Data_Cluster

## Description
This project builds a product recommendation system using unsupervised learning techniques on market basket data. By applying dimensionality reduction and clustering to user orders, the system identifies common purchase patterns and recommends relevant products, with a focus on addressing the cold-start problem for low-activity users.
